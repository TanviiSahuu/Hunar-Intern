*Data Science Internship - Hunar Intern*

This repository contains the work and projects completed during my Data Science Internship at Hunar Intern. During this internship, I was given various tasks to improve my data science and machine learning skills, including data cleaning, model building, and statistical analysis.

Tasks Completed:

Task 1: Data Cleaning
Objective: Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis by handling missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
Tools Used: Pandas, NumPy
Key Steps: Removed null values, filled missing data with appropriate strategies, handled duplicate rows, and performed outlier detection.

Task 2: Linear Regression
Objective: Build a linear regression model to predict a target variable based on input features.
Tools Used: Scikit-learn, NumPy
Key Steps: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Task 3: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Objective: Implement a KNN model to classify data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
Tools Used: Scikit-learn, NumPy
Key Steps: Prepared the dataset, performed feature scaling, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Task 4: Cat and Dog Classifier
Objective: Build a binary image classifier to distinguish between cat and dog images.
Tools Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
Key Steps: Preprocessed image data, built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN), and evaluated model performance using accuracy and loss.

Task 5: NumPy Array
Objective: Work with NumPy arrays to perform various mathematical operations and manipulations on large datasets.
Tools Used: NumPy
Key Steps: Created and manipulated arrays, performed matrix operations, and used NumPy functions for efficient computation on large datasets.

Task 6: Statistics
Objective: Analyze datasets and draw insights using statistical methods.
Tools Used: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
Key Steps: Conducted hypothesis testing, calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and performed correlation analysis.
